								<p>That’s me and my doggy Cheyenne. I’m the one on the right. Though I live
									in Austin, TX now, I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>	
									<p> I can speak English, <span lang="es"> Español</span> languages.</p>
									<p>I broke my neck at age 17 when I fell
									from a cliff. It was at Whipps Ledges in
									Ohio. The good news is, since then, I
									have had many adventures in 44
									countries. I’ve gone sailing, sky diving,
									scuba diving, paragliding, trekking in the
									mountains, enjoyed many more
									adventure sports and even made an
									expedition to Mt. Everest Base Camp.</p>						
									<p>When I had my accident, there was no
									alcohol or drugs involved. I want to
									make that clear. I just happened to be
									in the cliff area, on a picnic, with high
									school friends. My last memory is
									walking towards the cliffs. The next
									thing I remember is waking up in the
									hospital 2 weeks later. I broke my neck at the C-5 level causing instant
									paralysis from the shoulders down. There was no law suit or insurance
									settlement. Thankfully my father was a good provider and had great
									insurance. Still, my poor parents were saddled with tremendous medical
									bills.</p>						
									<p>I wish I could say my 11 month stay in a rehab center helped but the fact is,
									the only thing I learned there was that I would have to take charge of my
									life. I credit my parents and many friends to my successful rehabilitation.</p>						
									<p>My parents were hard working and taught me the habits of industry at an
									early age. They told me I could have anything I wanted, as long as I got a
									job to pay for it. That still applied after I broke my neck. They set an
									example by working hard and rarely complaining. If something needed to
									be done, they did it rather than make excuses why they couldn’t. That was
									a valuable life lesson for me, my older brother and my younger five siblings.
									I credit my mother for being a “stay at home” mom, and my father for
									always having several “irons in the fire” at any one time.</p>						
									<p>I finished high school while in the rehab center. I earned my first college
									degree at Kent State, in Ohio, where I made friends that changed my life.
									That’s where my destiny was first shaped, where I developed the love for
									traveling and realized there really could be much more to life. It’s been 40+
									years and I still stay in contact with those friends who became family.</p>						
									<p>My incredible friends helped me build an incredible life. They were mostly
									over achievers, high achievers, or simply people I admired, who all knew
									more than me. Since I only learn from people who are smarter or more
									talented than me, those are the people with whom I chose to associate.</p>						
									<p>After college I moved to New Mexico to get away from the snow and find a
									job. I was invited to join the Santa Fe Jaycees – a leadership training
									organization. They taught me about goal setting and giving back to the
									community. After working a few years at an ILC in Santa Fe, I moved to
									Albuquerque to get my MBA. Because of my disability, I was allowed extra
									time to take tests but I knew if I wanted to be successful, I would have to
									compete with my able-body peers. To that end, I took all tests and
									completed all projects in the same time as fellow students.</p>						
									<p>I created several assistive technologies that changed my life. Though they
									seem quite simple, they made a huge impact in my academic and vocational
									life.</p>						
									<p>I created a portable notebook-desk. I started with a standard notepad, then
									Velcro-ed my HP-12C calculator as well as my mini-computer that I
									programmed in Basic. I pushed buttons with a mouth-stick and wrote with
									a unique writing brace I made with the help of a clever occupational
									therapist. I never would have got a good job or my MBA without it. It had
									just 1 Velcro strap and I was able to put it on and take it off independently.
									That was a real game changer.</p>						
									<p>Goal setting was instrumental in much of my growth, particularly in
									education and traveling. By setting goals of getting my MBA by age 30 or
									going to X amount of countries or continents, it was easier to make plans.
									A goal without a plan is just a dream. As James Dean said, “Plan as if you’ll
									live forever; live as though you’ll die tomorrow.”</p>	
									<p>After working in New Mexico for several years I ended up in Austin, Texas
									where I live and work today. Austin is a mecca for people with disabilities.
									The weather here is beautiful year round and I made friends with folks in
									ADAPT, a disability rights organization. They too played a major role in my
									growth. ADAPT is a disability rights group that taught me the importance of
									asserting our civil rights. They taught me about individual responsibility in
									group processes. Participation in ADAPT actions really liberated my thinking.</p>					
									<p>I became an entrepreneur, and, after a time, a self-made millionaire. When
									I recognized the economy was changing, I jumped at the opportunity to take
									advantage of it. I bought and sold securities, leveraging my investments to
									the hilt. I parlayed my meager earnings into a tidy sum while using some of
									it to travel. Getting my MBA, I learned how to make a million dollars, I just
									didn’t learn how to keep it. That was a unique time in our history and I
									doubt we’ll ever see again. When the economy changed, I didn’t change
									with it quick enough. I lost most of my assets, including my fully accessible
									dream house I was having built. Suffice it to say, success favors the
									prepared mind. Experience, education and a lot of hard work had helped me
									build a business. I just wasn’t good at keeping the fruits of my labor.</p>					
									<p>I rebuilt my life – again. While designing a business card, I had an epiphany.
									I’ve had various job titles but I wanted a title that would never change.
									After all, my passions have remained constant. I realized that the only
									constant in my life is that I’m an Argonaut. I enjoy traveling, adventure
									and exploring as chronicled on my web page <a target="_blank" href="http://www.GenosPlace.org">www.GenosPlace.org <img src="images/externalTabIcon.png" alt="opens in a new tab"></a>. There,
									you will find many pictures and a few videos of some of my adventures in 44
									countries on 6 continents. From paragliding over the Swiss Alps to scuba
									diving in the Red Sea, I’ve enjoyed it all. I shared them on DVD and
									produced a show on public access TV called Geno’s Place.</p>					
									<p>In order to make my experiences more relevant, I created a new show called
									"The Gene And Dave" Show. Now, along with my co-host, Dave Dauber,
									create shows that are broadcast on Channel Austin. Our shows are
									captioned and archived at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.TheGeneAndDaveShow.com/">www.TheGeneAndDaveShow.com<img src="images/externalTabIcon.png" alt="opens in a new tab"></a></p>					
									<p>Looking back on my life, I have concluded that my station in life is due to
									my upbringing, friends and family, hard work, and both good and bad luck.
									I’ve learned "Life is the sum of all your choices." "People believe they make
									choices, but it may be more accurate to say that their choices make
									them." In the words of J. K. Rowling, "It is our choices that show what we
									truly are, far more than our abilities."</p>					
									<p>I’m available for public speaking.</p>

										<li><strong>0.00 </strong> Hi folks, Gene here from the Gene and Dave show. Well let’s start off with my good</li>
										<li><strong>0.05 </strong>  friend Plato who said, “Lack of activity destroys the good condition of every human</li>
										<li><strong>0.11  </strong> being while movement and methodical exercise save it and preserve it.” Now Plato was</li>
										<li><strong>0.18  </strong> a smart guy, he knew what he was talking about. Let me tell you what I did with my exercise</li>
										<li><strong>0.23  </strong> machine. Many years ago I bought an upper tone gym but I had problems using it. Now</li>
										<li><strong>0.29  </strong> this is the way a person’s suppose to sit in the upper tone gym. Tight in the middle</li>
										<li><strong>0.35  </strong> here with each of these tri-pins. The problem was my balance was so bad; it was so awkward</li>
										<li><strong>0.42  </strong> I just really couldn’t use it this way. Now I tried using just my right arm which</li>
										<li><strong>0.49  </strong> was OK but then my left arm didn’t get any exercise. And after awhile I just kind of</li>
										<li><strong>0.55  </strong> got frustrated with it and gave up on it. But then once I started NCPAD’s 14 week</li>
										<li><strong>1.02  </strong> program I got to thinking, I really ought to be able to do something with this device.</li>
										<li><strong>1.08  </strong> And sure enough I was able to do something. What I did was I took the tri-pins off the</li>
										<li><strong>1.15  </strong> right side, which were rubbing against my books anyway, they weren’t doing any good</li>
										<li><strong>1:21  </strong> there and I moved them over to the right side. Now, when I want to exercise my right arm</li>
										<li><strong>1:28  </strong> I sit right in the center there and I’m able to exercise my right arm no problem.</li>
										<li><strong>1:35  </strong> When I want to exercise my right arm I get out from the center and over to the right</li>
										<li><strong>1:40  </strong> side, and exercise that way. It’s fairly easy and now I can exercise regularly. If</li>
										<li><strong>1:47  </strong> you buy an exercise machine and it’s not working out the way you want, my experience</li>
										<li><strong>1:53  </strong> has been that most of these you can modify easily and if you can’t figure out how to</li>
										<li><strong>2:00  </strong> modify it I’m sure you’ve got friends who have a talent for doing this kind of thing,</li>
										<li><strong>2:05 </strong>  and would be happy to help you out. Well this is Gene, signing off till next time.</li>
