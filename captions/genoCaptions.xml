      <p begin="00:00:00" end="00:00:05">Hi folks, Gene here from the Gene and Dave show. Well let’s start off with my good</p>
      <p begin="00:00:05" end="00:00:11">friend Plato who said, “Lack of activity destroys the good condition of every human</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11" end="00:00:18">being while movement and methodical exercise save it and preserve it.” Now Plato was</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18" end="00:00:23">a smart guy, he knew what he was talking about. Let me tell you what I did with my exercise</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:23" end="00:00:29">machine. Many years ago I bought an upper tone gym but I had problems using it. Now</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29" end="00:00:35">this is the way a person’s suppose to sit in the upper tone gym. Tight in the middle</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35" end="00:00:42">here with each of these tri-pins. The problem was my balance was so bad; it was so awkward</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:42" end="00:00:49">I just really couldn’t use it this way. Now I tried using just my right arm which</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49" end="00:00:55">was OK but then my left arm didn’t get any exercise. And after awhile I just kind of</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55" end="00:01:02">got frustrated with it and gave up on it. But then once I started NCPAD’s 14 week</p>
      <p begin="00:01:02" end="00:01:08">program I got to thinking, I really ought to be able to do something with this device.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08" end="00:01:15">And sure enough I was able to do something. What I did was I took the tri-pins off the</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:15" end="00:01:21">right side, which were rubbing against my books anyway, they weren’t doing any good</p>
      <p begin="00:01:21" end="00:01:28">there and I moved them over to the right side. Now, when I want to exercise my right arm</p>
      <p begin="00:01:28" end="00:01:35">I sit right in the center there and I’m able to exercise my right arm no problem.</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:35" end="00:01:40">When I want to exercise my right arm I get out from the center and over to the right</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:40" end="00:01:47">side, and exercise that way. It’s fairly easy and now I can exercise regularly. If</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:47" end="00:01:53">you buy an exercise machine and it’s not working out the way you want, my experience</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:53" end="00:02:00">has been that most of these you can modify easily and if you can’t figure out how to</p>
	  <p begin="00:02:00" end="00:02:05">modify it I’m sure you’ve got friends who have a talent for doing this kind of thing,</p>
	  <p begin="00:02:05" end="00:02:10">and would be happy to help you out. Well this is Gene, signing off till next time.</p>
