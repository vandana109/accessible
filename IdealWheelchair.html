					<h1>My Ideal Wheelchair</h1>
					<p>After traveling in 40 countries on 6 continents, and engaging in extreme sports ranging from skydiving to scuba diving, from 
paragliding to trekking in the mountains, from  cliff climbing to sailing, I have designed the ideal manual wheelchair system. 
I say system because it includes the chair and "must have" modifications and accessories.</p>
					<section>
						<h2>Strength</h2>
						<div class="row">
							
						</div>
						<div class="row">
							<p>I often find myself in situations where strength is essential.  Whether I'm scaling a cliff in Socorro, NM or bridge swinging in South Africa, I want to be sure my wheelchair is not going to fall apart. That includes the back, armrests, wheels, and foot rests.  I don't even want to see so much as a bend in my wheelchair. That's why my ideal wheelchair is built out of titanium. 
The other advantage of titanium is that it is light. Unfortunately, it is very expensive.  I would rather
pay the extra bucks than find out the hard way that my chair just wasn't strong enough.  The airlines
bent up one of my chairs years ago.  I want to make sure that never happens again. </p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Weight</h2>
						<div class="row">
							
						</div>
						<div class="row">
							<p>Weight is important because I am often lifted while in my wheelchair.  Most of that time I am lifted by several people,
as when I am hoisted up to the ship's crow's nest, or hoisted up from a zodiac at sea.  But usually, I am lifted only by 1 or
2 people.  Getting onto sailboats or into small places, I am usually lifted by 2 people.  My friend Davin, however, lifted me 
totally by himself when he brought me up all the steps to the Acropolis in Greece.
             

Sometimes I have to make very tight turns and get lifted over all sorts of things, so I repeat, light weight is important. </p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Shape/Size</h2>
						<div class="row">
							
						</div>
						<div class="row">
							<p>My ideal wheelchair must be as small as possible.  When traveling by boat through the jungles of Costa Rica, I took the wheels 
off the back, put my sea-legs down, and had my guide put me on the bow.  You can't do that with any other
wheelchair.  I don't often sit on elephants or ride in rowboats but I do often need to take my rear wheels off so I can set the
wheelchair on a bench seat.  I have no trunk balance so I need to stay in my chair while using alternate transportation.  For that
reason I like to have at least a 12 inch straight tube under my chair, before it bends to attach to the front of the chair.</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Modifications /Accessories </h2>
						<div class="row">
							
						</div>
						<div class="row">
							<p>There are 2 accessories and 1 modification I have found to be very invaluable.  The first is a backpack, not the type with straps
that wears out the chair back upholstery, but the kind made specifically for wheelchairs, that hangs on the wheelchair push
handles. The second is called a "Catch All".  It forms a net shelf under the wheelchair seat. It securely attaches with Velcro
hook and loop to bottom horizontal and rear vertical frame tubing.  It's a great way to utilize wasted space.  Both items are
available from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.advantagebag.com/index.html">Advantage Bag Company <img src="images/externalTabIcon.png" class="extTabIcon" alt="opens in a new tab"></a>.  I've used these items extensively while backpacking around the world.</p>
							<p>While exploring a cave in Texas, I needed to take my rear wheels off to fit
through a narrow passage.  Without rear wheels though, I needed someone to hold up 
the back of my wheelchair.  That got old rather quickly.  Later, while in traveling in 
Mexico I realized the need again for something I call sea-legs.  I gave a design to our 
good friends at PROJIMO and asked them to make them for me.  They worked well.  
Later, my brother redesigned and built them.  They may look like anti-tippers but my 
sea-legs are designed to support my body weight in addition to keeping the chair from 
flipping over backwards.  I call them sea-legs because I have used them extensively 
while sailing.</p>
							<p>They are actually multi-use legs.  If I find myself in a hotel with an inaccessible                
shower, I just have my attendant either put my chair (without wheels, with sea-legs 
down) in the shower and have him lift me into it. While in South Africa, on safari, 
I had him put me in my chair and we took the wheels off just before pushing into the 
shower. There have been times when traveling with someone not quite strong enough 
to lift me, I would take one wheel off and slide the chair right next to the bed. It 
was then easy enough to do a sliding transfer.  Otherwise, my attendant would have 
to try and slide me over the wheel - not quite possible. When not in use, my sea-legs 
are in the up position.</p>
							<p></p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Brakes</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<p>Since my chair will need to be as narrow as possible when I take the wheels off, the brakes must be kept from protruding beyond the side of
the wheelchair.  Scissor type brakes should work.</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Color</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<p>I don't want my chair mistaken for an airport chair or anyone else's chair.  I want it to stand out, be easy to see.  I therefor have decided I
want it "Hummer" yellow.</p>
